<p>If you eat outdoors here, you have a view of the Shawangunk Ridge as it drains down into the New Paltz Golf Course. Indoors, choose the original1759 stone tavern or &nbsp;the elegant 1830's wing. Jeremy Kolakowskiâ€™s New American bistro-style menu sources from local farms, and truth be told, many people just go for&nbsp;the cocktails with names like "Bitter-Sweet Symphony," "The Goodnight, Gracie," "Fitzcarraldo"&nbsp;--&nbsp;and don't mess with "Honey Badger."</p><h3></h3>
