<p>Dia:Beacon occupies a massive (240,000 sq ft!)&nbsp;former Nabisco box printing facility that was renovated for the purposes of presenting Dia Art Foundation's collection from the 1960's to the present as well as mounting special temporary exhibitions and hosting a bevy of education programs. What's so unique about this facility is that the huge&nbsp;spaces are suited to large-scale installations, sculpture and paintings, and each gallery was designed specifically for the art it contains. As the Times notes, since it opened, "it &nbsp;has&nbsp;been a must-see spot on the contemporary-art circuit."</p><p>http://www.diaart.org</p>
