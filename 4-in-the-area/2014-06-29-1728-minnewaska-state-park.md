<p>At 21,106 acres and occupying part of&nbsp;New Paltz, Gardiner and&nbsp;Ellenville, the Minnewaska State Park Preserve is a behemoth size wise, but is also amenable to all levels of hikers and walkers. The hikes are predominately on&nbsp;carriage trails, and while there is plenty of vertical, it is never too daunting and generally all&nbsp;open to hiking, biking, horseback and XC skiing.&nbsp;Along with its two famous lakes Awosting and Minnewaska, the park contains a bey of fun destinations&hellip; a short list:&nbsp;Gertrude's Nose, Verkeerder Kill Falls<strong>, </strong>Margaret Cliff, Awosting Falls, Stony Kill Falls, Beacon Hill, Litchfield Ledge, Rainbow Falls, and the High Peters Kill cliffs.&nbsp;</p><p>http://nysparks.com/parks/127/details.aspx</p>
