<p>This facility is the locus of several practitioners' work in "healing" methods from meditation to nutrition to counseling. Also notable is the building itself with a&nbsp;contemporary&nbsp;design inspired by a local Dutch&nbsp;stone farmhouse dated 1753 which has been&nbsp;re-imagined with curves and playful forms to be welcoming and less severe.</p><p>http://stoneridgehealingarts.com</p>
