<p>Closest to Hudson Woods, and a&nbsp;moderately challenging course, the Rondout Valley Golf Club is also 18 holes of beautiful scenery. Seldom crowded (except when morning tournaments happen) the casual attitude and meandering holes make it a pleasurable day. We recommend afternoon play to catch the late light and after the 18th enjoy the deck of Ivan's bar that looks out over the valley course.</p><p>http://www.rondoutgolfclub.com</p>
