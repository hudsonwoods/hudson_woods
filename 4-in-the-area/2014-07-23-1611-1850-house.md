<p>As the name suggests, the "house"&nbsp;has been operatod as a hotel since 1850, when its was built during the cement mining boom in Rosendale. The newest owners have restored it and it's 11 rooms&nbsp;with historical&nbsp;integrity and&nbsp;de rigueur modern amenities,&nbsp;and most&nbsp;importantly, they&nbsp;have revived the public&nbsp;tavern. The newest thing to&nbsp;love&nbsp;about the Inn is the recently installed and enormous deck off the back of the hotel overlooking the lazy Rondout Creek. It&nbsp;serves as an extension to the tavern, and&nbsp;light fare is available, and is bound to be the locus of Rosendale's social life.</p>
