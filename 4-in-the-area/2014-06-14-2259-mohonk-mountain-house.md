<p>The grand dame of all Hudson Valley resorts (and longest surviving), the Mountain House is perched in one of the most memorable settings in the country. It's also enormous, pretty expensive an unbelievably popular. The fairly new spa comes highly recommended by the most discriminating indulgers, and rather old&nbsp;nine hole golf course set in a mountain is a wild pitch and putt. Skating in the winter is perfect and the grounds throughout the rest of the year are brilliantly gardened.</p>
