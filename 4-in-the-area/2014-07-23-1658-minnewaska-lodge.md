<p>Just over the 'Gunks from Hudson Woods is a hotel that earns the word "lodge." Tall ceilings, huge windows, lots of wood, an&nbsp;outdoor fire pit and adirondack chairs. The huge back yard abuts the sheer and somewhat intimidating cliffs of the Shawangunk Ridge and the surround 22,000 acres of state preserve. You practically fall out of bed onto a hiking trail.</p><p>http://www.minnewaskalodge.com</p>
