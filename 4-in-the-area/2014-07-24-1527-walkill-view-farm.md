<p>Possibly the best reason to visit this amazing farmer's market (and bakery and nursery) is to soak in the views that it affords. Plunked in the middle of hundreds of acres of fields, the market is&nbsp;backgrounded by the humpbacked Shawangunk escarpment punctuated by the Skytop Tower. Many of the other reasons to visit include the huge variety of produce, the baked goods, the locally produced cheeses and&nbsp;the fact that it is a family business like so many of the farms in the area.</p><p>http://wallkillviewfarm.snappages.com/home.htm</p>
