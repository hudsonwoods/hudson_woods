<p>The Davenport family has been&nbsp;farming on this land&nbsp;since Isaiah Davenport moved across the Hudson River from Duchess County to Ulster in the 1840s, and a family&nbsp;member&nbsp;can be found working in every phase of our farm and farm&nbsp;stand, from planting and harvesting, managing the greenhouses. The farm produces baked goods and carries local products while the rather robust nursery has a tons&nbsp;of plant life, is well stocked with trees and&nbsp;shrubs and carries&nbsp;some really good pottery to put them in. Our favorite thing about davenport is the winsome illustration&nbsp;they employ throughout all their&nbsp;advertising and identity. It was conceived by famed fashion Illustrator Joe Eula and carries on in his style since his passing.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.davenportfarms.com">http://www.davenportfarms.com</a></p>
