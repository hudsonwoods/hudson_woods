<p>America's oldest continuously operating inn has all the historic trappings one would expect:&nbsp;wide-plank floors, beamed ceilings, and a stone hearth. It is a very august presence in the town&nbsp;where Chelsea Clinton got married, and&nbsp;contains&nbsp;the sturdy Bogardus Tavern, a&nbsp;stage coach stop and&nbsp;hangout for revolutionaries, built to&nbsp;withstand an Indian attack.&nbsp;And of course, George Washington slept here.&nbsp;It's&nbsp;"sister" inn, the Delameter Inn a clock away is&nbsp;considered an American Gothic masterpiece.</p><p>http://www.beekmandelamaterinn.com/beekmanarms.htm</p>
