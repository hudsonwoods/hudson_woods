<p>This historic orchard has been producing apples for over two hundred years, but that doesn't mean they haven't been keeping up with the times. In two major re-plantings, dozens of new gourmet varieties were added on semi-dwarfing or fully dwarfing rootstocks that produce bigger, sweeter and redder fruit. Most recently they have started diversifying into other fruits including&nbsp;sweet cherries, peaches, nectarines, plums and Asian pears. Most of this can be picked on site, or&nbsp;along with produce from dozens of local farm scan be handily purchased at their gourmet market.</p><p>http://www.stoneridgeorchard.us</p>
