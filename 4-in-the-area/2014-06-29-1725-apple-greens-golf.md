<p>Just west of New Paltz, this working apple orchard shares space with 27 holes of challenging but entertaining golf&nbsp;terrain. It's also beautiful course worthy of its own&nbsp;day trop from the city.&nbsp;It's quite something to be retrieving errant balls from between the neat&nbsp;rows of apple laden trees. Wonderful in all seasons, but particularly late summer and early fall when you can sample the produce.&nbsp;</p><p>http://www.applegreens.com</p>
