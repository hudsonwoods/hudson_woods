<p>After&nbsp;12 generations in the same family, Saunderskill Farm&nbsp;isnâ€™t just an historical curiosity, but is a thriving, growing business with almost 500 acres in production, a sprawling nursery served by 15 <a href="http://www.saunderskill.com/greenhouse.shtml">greenhouses</a>, a newly expanded 3100 square foot <a href="http://www.saunderskill.com/farm_market.shtml">market</a> selling their produce and stocked with scores of other locally sourced goods (bacon! honey! flatbread pizza! granola!), and a brilliant kitchen and bakery serving dozens of fresh items. Those in the area liken the market to a kind of a calendar; one can see the seasons revolve as each newly picked crop finds its way to the shelves.</p><p>http://www.saunderskill.com</p>
