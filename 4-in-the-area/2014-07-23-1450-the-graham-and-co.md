<p>The side project of 4 enterprising Brooklynites working in the realms of fashion and design, the Graham & Co is a formerly&nbsp;renovated just enough to be cool,&nbsp;with a mix of&nbsp;mid century modern and quaint American.&nbsp;Camp-like features include outdoor movie nights, a fire pit, inner tubes in the pool&nbsp;and a&nbsp;rustic bar. Their 20 rooms are&nbsp;very popular among the twee, so book early!</p><p><cite>www.<strong>thegraham</strong>andco.com</cite></p>
