<p>Only 11 years old,&nbsp;Keegan Ales Brewery in Kingston is now a Hudson Valley staple and a testament&nbsp;to local sourcing and production. Tommy Keegan found the abandoned building with a defunct brewery inside, and after much toil, rebuilt the brewery and the bottling operation until it now creates 8 regular styles and countless seasonal batches.</p><p>Tours of the brewery are available Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from 1-6pm,&nbsp;at the top of each hour. Or just inform yourself by sitting&nbsp;at the bar & restaurant with their full line up of&nbsp;beers and seasonal specialties.&nbsp;After some courage,&nbsp;you can your&nbsp;release your inner brewer by kitting up the home brew supply store right next door.</p><p>http://www.keeganales.com</p>
