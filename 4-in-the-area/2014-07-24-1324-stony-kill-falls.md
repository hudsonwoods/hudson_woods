<p>The reward for this relatively brief walk in a Wawarsing (next town over from Hudson Woods)&nbsp;portion of&nbsp;Minnewaska State park&nbsp;is a stunning 90 foot waterfall flowing&nbsp;over a sheer cliff face into pristine swimming hole. Above the fall is a pool from which&nbsp;there are&nbsp;marvelous views of the&nbsp;Stony Creek and Roundout Valleys, into Sullivan County, and even the occasional nudist in&nbsp;the&nbsp;pool itself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TxfZC">https://goo.gl/maps/TxfZC</a></p><p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Kill_Falls</p>
