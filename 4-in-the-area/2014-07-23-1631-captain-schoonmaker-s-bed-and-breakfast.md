<p>Captain Frederick Schoonmaker was a local Civil War hero whose dedication (and donations) to the war&nbsp;effort meant that of his large estate,&nbsp;only the stone&nbsp;house remained in his name when the war ended. For the past 30 years, it has been a well know bed & breakfast with, how shall we say, quaint charm.</p><p>http://www.captainschoonmakers.com</p>
