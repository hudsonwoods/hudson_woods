<p>Known as the world's&nbsp;finest sculpture park, the&nbsp;Storm King Arts Center is something that one must visit to understand how remarkable it is. Over 100 intelligently sited&nbsp;works of the most acclaimed artists of our times dot the&nbsp;500 brilliantly landscaped&nbsp;acres. Calder, Serra, Bourgeois, Dubuffet, Moore, Judd, Smith&hellip; the name dropping alone will make you feel more cultured. An absolute must for the life list...</p><p><a href="http://www.stormkingartcenter.org/">www.stormkingartcenter.org</a></p>
