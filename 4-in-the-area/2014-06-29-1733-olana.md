<p>Get your Hudson River School of landscape painting&nbsp;fix at the former home of&nbsp;Frederic Edwin Church, the star pupil of Thomas Cole. This&nbsp;grand and somewhat eccentric mansion of Church and Calvert Vaux's design&nbsp;is a&nbsp;mixture of Victorian, Persian and Moorish style. It&nbsp;is lavishly accoutered with objects from his extensive travels, contains over 40 of his paintings,&nbsp;and his studio&nbsp;remains&nbsp;much as it was. The estate was once a&nbsp;working farm and frames one of the most famous views of the Hudson River valley.</p>
