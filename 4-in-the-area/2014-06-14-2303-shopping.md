<p>A landmark restaurant run by a landmark local, this formerly infamous&nbsp;tavern has been restored&nbsp;and lovingly&nbsp;maintained for over 44 years&nbsp;by Chef John Novi. The unofficial mayor of High Falls, Novi is also deeply connected to local growers and works that knowledge into his menu that some call&nbsp;"kitchen&nbsp;theater." Be prepared to settle in for a while. Currently over-serving at these times.</p><h4>Friday: 5-10pm<br>Saturday: 10am-3pm, 5-10pm<br>Sunday: 10am-4pm</h4>
