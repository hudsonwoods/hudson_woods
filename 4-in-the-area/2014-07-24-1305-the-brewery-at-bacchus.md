<p>Amidst the kitchen&nbsp;chaos of an busy New Paltz Restaurant already well know for it's&nbsp;excellent craft beer selection, the Brewery at Bacchus&nbsp;quietly came to life 2 years ago and operates as a&nbsp;series of experiments with unusual beers categories:&nbsp;Brett saisons, farmhouse ales aged on fruit, dark sours, 100% Brett IPAs, whiskey-aged imperial stouts. Because it's such a small operation, there is limited&nbsp;production and each barrel goes quickly even though&nbsp;only one of the taps at the bar serves their own beer. All the more reason to visit.</p><p>&nbsp;http://www.bacchusnewpaltz.com/brewery</p>
