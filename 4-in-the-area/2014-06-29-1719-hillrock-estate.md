<p>The Hillrock Distillery, Malt House, Granary and Barrel Houses are a “field-to-glass” craft distilling operation, i.e. farm-to-table for booze.&nbsp;The Distillery "barn"&nbsp;houses Hillrock’s custom-made copper distillation equipment that gives them extraordinary control over the character and quality of each small batch, and allowing then to price their products in the upper echelons. They produce Hillrock&nbsp;Solera Aged Bourbon, and will release a single malt whiskey and a rye in the coming months.</p><p>Tours by appointment only!</p><p><a href="http://hillrockdistillery.com/" target="_blank" style="background-color: initial;">http://hillrockdistillery.com/</a></p>
