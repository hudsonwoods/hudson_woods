<p>The nine holes of the Mohonk Mountain House Golf Course are set among the mountain terrain of the Shawangunk Ridge, and so playing here is a bit like riding a roller coaster. Each hole mounts it's own special challenge on a small foot print with limited sight lines, and yet it's still&nbsp;very fun to play while giving you quite the workout if you choose to walk it.&nbsp;Also&nbsp;unusual is that fact that the course has been in use for over 117 years, making it one of America's oldest. Public course and&nbsp;available to non-guests.</p><p>http://www.mohonk.com/activities/overnight/outdoors#Golf</p>
