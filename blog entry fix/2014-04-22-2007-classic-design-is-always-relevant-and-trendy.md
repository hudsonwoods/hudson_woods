<p><img src="/assets/img/journal/01.jpg"></p><p>Last week we introduced you to Jessica Wickham and her influence from Japanese craftsmanship tradition. This week, we’d like to turn your attention to another culture rich in design tradition focused on flexibility, durability and cleanliness.</p><p>Founded in Switzerland as a producer of iron works and window fittings in 1885, <a href="http://www.usm.com/en-us/">USM Modular Furniture</a> has been producing iconic furniture designs since 1961. In 1988 the the USM Haller (above) was recognized as a work of applied art in Germany, and in 2001 the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York added it to its design collection.</p><p>It can also be found at our Hudson Woods model home. The modular aspect of the design makes it a great fit for a variety of spaces and enables customization for specific needs. Key to USM’s philosophy is ensuring on a long lifespan for  their products, using only high quality, durable materials and manufacturing with the newest environmentally friendly technologies. A long lifespan means less impact.</p><p>USM is also taking part in the <a href="http://www.elledecor.com/shopping/what-we-love/beoriginal#slide-1">Be Original Campaign by ELLE DECOR US</a> which supports designers right to be protected from counterfeits. An exhibition to be held during International Contemporary Furniture Fair (ICFF) in May will contrast a “real deal” to an imitation and highlight the values and history hidden behind the original piece.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/6-20140717200916.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/usm_large_bkshelf_200dpi.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/7-20140717201035.jpg"></p><p><br><img src="/assets/img/journal/27202d2746673a949adddad1e82993a0.jpg"></p><p><br><img src="/assets/img/journal/contemporary-nightstands-and-bedside-tables.jpg"></p><p>A panel of experts from ELLE DECOR have included USM in the magazine’s&nbsp;coveted Top 10 list of Credenzas and Sideboards.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/4-20140717201118.jpg"></p><p>USM and Surface Magazine held a party at their New York showroom to celebrate the&nbsp;Magazine’s new Art Issue.<img src="/assets/img/journal/5-20140717201143.jpg"></p><p>In 1885 USM was founded as a hardware and locksmith’s business in&nbsp;Muensingen, Switzerland by Ulrich Schaerer.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/11-20140717201236.jpg"></p><p>You can keep up with all the happenings at USM on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/usmmodularfurniture?fref=ts">Facebook page</a>.</p>
