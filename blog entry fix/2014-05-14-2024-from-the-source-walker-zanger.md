They have developed a special relationship with the prized marble and stone from quarries throughout the world, each individually selected and evaluated by experienced stone masters.</p><p>A material we are particularly fond of at Hudson Woods is the grey quartzite tile which provides a subtle but rich texture for a large open bathroom layout. Tactile and earthy, its unique nature and rough hewn surface make it a perfect companion to other elemental materials like wood, glass and metal.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/HudsonWoodsBathroom.png"></p><p>The pure white Soho ceramic tiles will be used in the other bathroom at the Hudson Woods model home. A nod to New York tradition and heritage, itâ€™s a clean and crisp design that creates a light and airy atmosphere. Below is a construction photo from the model house and a finished example.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/HudsonWoodsBathroom2-20140717203032.png"></p><p>The classic chevron pattern, below, has recently been making a strong a comeback as well. It looks particularly great when a variety of materials are used to contrast the angular wood details.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/10001579_10152343512056488_7914265008992038850_n.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/10336811_10152388132081488_5290033169406413361_n.png"></p><p>Below is a pattern layout of various Walker Zanger ceramic tiles</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/1973379_10152309701741488_8027307587261704449_o1.jpg"></p><p>The AnTeak collection is made of FSC-certified reclaimed wood and comes in 7 pattern options including chevron, herringbone and penny tile.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/1922441_10152344501756488_4042403082693996915_n1.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/1476293_10152096842391488_1240705908_n.jpg"></p>
