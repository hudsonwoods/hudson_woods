<p>As a partner, Carl Hansen and Søn have the same founding tenets as Hudson Woods. Their products are designed intelligently, and executed with skill and precision. The wood is from sustainably managed forests and is treated in a way that is as gentle as possible for the environment. Sustainability is as key for them as it is for us.</p><p>In 1908, Carl Hansen founded his company on the belief that outstanding craftsmanship and rational serial production could go hand-in-hand to provide customers with high-quality furniture at a reasonable price. Today, their skilled craftsmen use traditional woodworking techniques aided by the latest technology to produce furniture of lasting value. Every piece comes with a story– one of  vision, careful thought and skilled craftsmanship, just like the homes of Hudson Woods.</p><p>See Carl Hansen and Søn <a href="http://www.carlhansen.com/frontpage/">here.</a></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/hand.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/unnamed3.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/t-20140717185549.png"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/drawer-detail.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/couch-whole.jpg" style="background-color: initial;"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/chair-whole1.jpg"></p>
