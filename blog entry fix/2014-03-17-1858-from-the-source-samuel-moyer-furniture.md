<p>At Samuel Moyer Furniture, a vital element of the design process is to develop a unique relationship with each built item. When Hudson Woods and Sam came together there was an immediate kinship, sharing an affinity for natural living.</p><p>Sam and his wife Casey moved from Los Angeles to Upstate New York in pursuit of a more authentic life. Surrounded by the “idyllic natural splendor” of the area, they are more inspired to do the work they love. Sam’s ethos revolves around reuse of materials, finding a hidden story in the age and character of salvaged wood. He is reminded of a quote passed onto him by a friend, “what you pay attention to makes you who you are.”</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/2.jpg"></p><p>Sam is collaborating with Hudson Woods to custom build a freestanding kitchen pantry made from ethically sourced solid Black Walnut wood with a hand-rubbed oil finish, soapstone counter, custom in-laid brass details and leather door pulls.</p><p>Sam and Casey will be exhibiting at the Architectural Digest Home Show next week from March 20 – March 23 and you can visit their website here: <a href="http://samuelmoyerfurniture.com/">samuelmoyerfurniture.com</a>. They also write a blog called <a href="http://junqueontheroad.wordpress.com/">junque on the road</a> about their adventures fixing up the old house they moved into upstate.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/3.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/4.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/5.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/6.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/7.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/8.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/10.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/11-20140717191105.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/12.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/13.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/14.jpg"></p><p><em>Black Walnut being prepared to become the custom kitchen pantry</em></p>
