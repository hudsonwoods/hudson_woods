From industrial design, to interior design to Architecture and installations, over the past 5 years they have developed a prolific portfolio of beautiful work. Founded by Stefanie Brechbueler and Robert Highsmith, their beautifully distinctive style draws from responsible design that works to create a sense of place for both the objects they contain and the people that experience them.</p><p>Inspired by rich materials and simple forms they rely heavily on process and always remaining authentic by allowing context and intuition to guide their way.</p><p>Recently the Workstead team completed work on the much talked about <a href="http://wythehotel.com/">Wythe hotel</a> in Brooklyn and have produced a collection of <a href="http://www.workstead.com/shop.html">lighting fixtures</a> that are subtle yet gracefully hold a presence of their own, helping to pull a room together in the appropriate way. At the Hudson Woods model home you will be able to find the chandelier pictured below in the entry hall.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/2_Chandelier.jpg"></p><p>We’re excited to see how this piece will make a powerful impact as one of the first elements people see when stepping into the home. It will create a warm and comfortable atmosphere that will prevail throughout the home.</p><p>We’re also featuring the bent wall lamp being installed in the studio/garage to create a comfortable working space with the proper amount of lighting and style.</p><p><br><img src="/assets/img/journal/unnamed.png"></p><p>These lighting fixtures are customizable or prefabricated and hang in the Levi’s flagship store in Tokyo, the Facebook headquarters, Barney’s Co-op in Brooklyn, and the homes of Kelly Klein and Darren Aronofsky.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/779778d75a9c205ec77a61458616b5ed.c894426a359e422fa5b8efb3fc8101d8.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/1d251f34fb0d6c36d6e9360f01a85752.c894426a359e422fa5b8efb3fc8101d8.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/Workstead1.gif"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/Workstead2.gif"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/329ba8865f465f6dfa45d7b8048e3ccd.c894426a359e422fa5b8efb3fc8101d8.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/c8e489c0d87ac694d058fa37fd55ab6f.c894426a359e422fa5b8efb3fc8101d8.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/533eec4450950c4f0e1e22d525286eb6.c894426a359e422fa5b8efb3fc8101d8.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/f44fe04cfc71d6a36530545a2f6a3937.c894426a359e422fa5b8efb3fc8101d8.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/523329_496506390367367_2005824558_n.jpg"></p>
