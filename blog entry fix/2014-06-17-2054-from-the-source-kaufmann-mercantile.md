Sustainable and ethical practices are of utmost importance along with criteria such as precision, durability, strength, aesthetics, uniqueness and tradition. They sell only what they use in daily life so about one percent of items researched make it to the shop.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/x2.jpg"> </p><p><em>Sebastian Kaufmann at the Amagansett Summer Store</em></p><p>Located in Brooklyn they maintain a constantly growing involvement with New York, participating in a <a href="http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/shinola-nyc-tribeca-store.php">pop-up shop with Shinola</a>, the recently launched <a href="https://www.everlane.com/open-house">Open House by Everlane</a> and recently opening a summer pop-up shop of their own in Amagansett.
