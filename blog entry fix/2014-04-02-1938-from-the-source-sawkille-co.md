They even turn their studio into a community gallery to host a variety of artist receptions.</p><p>“We draw from the heritage of the Hudson Valley; from people creating and working to build a life around what is meaningful to them. In reflecting on this heritage and the vibrant community of artisans all around, we feel excited to be a part of what we call Rural American Design.”</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/121.jpg"></p><p>Every piece that is meticulously hand crafted carries with it this undeniable flavor. With a value for furniture that improves in character through time and use, their pieces meld into  a rough but glamorous aesthetic. Organic and honest their furniture results in a particularly rare experience adding something lovely and inspiring to the environment you cultivate.</p><p>It is this dedication to community and craftsmanship that excites us at Hudson Woods to be working with Sawkille.
