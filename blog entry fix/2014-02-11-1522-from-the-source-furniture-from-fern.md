<p>In our journal for the next few months, we will introduce all of our furniture vendor/partners and ultimately display their furniture in the Hudson Woods model home. We encourage our buyers to and all of our readers to consider their work and will publish a catalog of the furniture and accessories in our model home with instructions on how to purchase.</p><p>Fern was founded in 2009 by designer and maker, Jason Roskey and his wife Maggie Goudsmith. While they run a showroom in Hudson, NY, their studio is located in nearby Germantown, giving them close access to some of the countryâ€™s finest hardwoods, in particular Maple and Black Walnut. By only using wood from trees harvested near the end of their relatively short life spans, they manufacture contemporary yet timeless pieces using sustainable methods.</p><p>See Fern <a href="http://www.fernnyc.com/">here</a>.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/IMG_5137.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/unnamed1.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/blogger-image-207408398.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/jason_5.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/unnamed2.jpg"></p>
