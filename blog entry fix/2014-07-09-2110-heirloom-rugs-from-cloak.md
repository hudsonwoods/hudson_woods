We find kinship in the simplicity, precision and functionality of both vintage and contemporary design that emerges from these lands. Always reliable and durable, longevity is a top priority and makes for terrific heirloom pieces that can be passed down for generations.</p><p>We’ve previously featured iconic furniture from <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/from-the-source-modernlink/">Modernlink</a>, vintage pieces from <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/places-we-like-scandinavian-grace/">Scandinavian Grace,</a> kitchen appliances from <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/classic-design-is-always-relevant-and-trendy/">USM</a> and sustainable wood burning stoves from <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/making-fire-with-authenticity-and-innovation-2/">Wittus Fire</a>. Another bit of heirloom design we’ll be displaying comes from <a href="http://hudsonwoods.com/blog/heirloom-rugs-from-cloak/www.cloak.ch">Cloak rugs</a>. Founded in 2014 by Samuel Ruckstuhl, Cloak is a carpet company dedicated to architects and interior designers. With a family legacy of more than hundred years of carpet weaving in Switzerland, Cloak uniquely combines this ancient craft of carpet making with a contemporary design approach. Make sure to stay tuned as Cloak is set to relaunch their website in early August.</p><p>The Lanura undyed virgin wool rug (pictured below and in the title image) will be placed in the great room. It is made from wool in its pure state, spun to yarn by hand and then woven by hand as well.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/tappeti-modernos-tinta-unita-sisal-51089-7302739-20140717214603.jpg"></p><p>In the downstairs den, the Agave rug (below) made of sisal natural plant fibers, helps bring the room together. A timeless carpet classic of practically unlimited versatility it works both as an area rug and wall to wall carpeting.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/Bild-33-Teppich-Jaipur-bathtub-Ruckstuhl-20140717214617.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/l2_p333051_488_336-1-20140717214629.jpg"></p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/ruckstuhl_jaipure_001Large-20140717214654.jpg"></p><p>Finally in the children’s bedroom houses the feltro rug, made from of pure new wool fibers. It is available in 30 colors making it easy to find a vibrant hue for the kids. We went selected a turquoise color.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/journal/Feltro_color_40180_1-20140717214707.png"></p>
